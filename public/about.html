<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Adam Morales. I graduated from FSU with a B.S. in Computer Science.
    I have dabbled in various different subfields of CS, but I keep coming back to Web
    Development. I suppose I am attracted to creative and design aspects of this discipline,
    something that I feel the other disciplines lack. My porfolio may be small, however, 
    I pick things up quickly and have every intention of adding more projects. 
</p>

<p>Another CS discipline that I have become enticed by is Game Development. I think that the
   creative nature of it makes much more enjoyable to do, much like Web Development. I'm not 
   as far along with Game Development as I am with Web Development, but it would be nice to, 
   at some point, combine the two a design my own gaming site.
